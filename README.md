## Buying and Selling Property
This app allows a user to list and buy properties.

### How it works
A user will list their property for sale. The information associated with the property is stored on [Pi√±ata](https://www.pinata.cloud/), including images. An [OpenZeppelin ERC721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/erc721) token is created for the property. All contracts are coded with [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) in [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

The token contract inherits ERC721 as well as a custom contract for transfering Ether from buyer to seller through the contract.
